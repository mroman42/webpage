#+TITLE: FAQ on my Health

I have received some questions about my health. It does affect my
research and I commonly find myself having to explain my current
situation, so I have decided to write this note on my webpage.

I got infected with COVID-19 on december 2020, with a low-grade fever
and general tiredness that lasted for two months. In january, I started
developing paresthesias and bilateral tinnitus, around march, I started
presenting all the symptoms of a neurological disorder called "visual snow
syndrome".

* What is visual snow syndrome?
Quoting the [[https://www.visualsnowinitiative.org/learn/][Visual Snow Initiative]]:

#+begin_quote
Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS), is a neurological condition that has
devastating effects on an individualâ€™s vision, hearing, and cognitive
functioning. Once believed to be rare, it now known that thousands of
people from around the world of all ages and walks of life are
affected by it. Most often, the condition causes people to process
visual information abnormally, making normal life more difficult for
them. Patients see flashing lights, flickering dots, and static, all
of which obstruct their visual field 24/7. There is no relief for
them, even when their eyes are closed. What differentiates Visual Snow
symptoms from other fleeting phenomena is that they are constant, not
temporary, meaning that they do no go away on their own. The condition
also has an array of non-visual symptoms.

Visual snow syndrome is an (uncommon) neurological disorder catalogued
on the [[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0333102417738202][International Classification of Headache Disorders]] (ICHD-3). I
can give a very simplified (and possibly incorrect) explanation of it.
Our brains filter out a lot of sensory noise and disturbances on our
ears, sight and touch. Visual snow syndrome occurs when the brain has
difficulties filtering this information out. This makes the patient
have to deal consciously and constantly with a lot of abnormal sensory
inputs.
