** Stillness is the Key, by Ryan Holiday
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       51f47ca3-1d6b-45fb-98ed-f625c39b7d8a
:END:

: Anyone who has concentrated so deeply that a flash of insight or inspiration suddenly visited him knows stillness.  Anyone who has walked out alone on a quiet street as the snow fell, warmed by the contentment of being alive knows stillness. â€” Ryan Holiday

Stillness gives us vision to think clearly, take the correct decisions, manage
our emotions and excel on what we do. The plan of this book is to seek that
inner peace. Every religion agrees on the importance of stillness: ataraxia for the epicureans, aequanimitas for the Christians, samatuam, uppekha, aslama, apatheia.
